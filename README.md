The Email and Password Authentication Project is a web application designed to allow users to securely register, log in, and manage their accounts using email and password credentials. It features a user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless navigation, enabling new users to create accounts with email and password validations to ensure proper format and strength. The project includes login functionality that authenticates users while providing error handling for incorrect credentials. Additionally, it implements session management to maintain user authentication states and offers a password recovery option via email for forgotten passwords. With a focus on security, the project employs encryption for password storage and adheres to best practices to prevent unauthorized access, making it an essential example of effective user account management in web applications.
